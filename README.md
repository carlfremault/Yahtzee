A little C# Project by Carl Fremault
15/11/2020

Just a little project to play around.
Obviously I'm a total beginner as far as programming is concerned.
I wanted to try out some UI ideas, create something simple, intuitive and efficient.
While functional the program is definitely not optimized, I have a lot to learn!

Thanks for checking this out,

Carl.
